# Scraper-App-Web

**Project Description:**

Scraper-App-Web is a web scraping application developed using Java and JSoup, designed to gather laptop product data from popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Trendyol, N11, and Teknosa. The extracted information is stored in a PostgreSQL database for efficient access and organization.

The back-end is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable solution for web scraping and data management. Java handles the back-end logic, including web scraping functionality and database integration. On the front-end, React is used to create a dynamic and user-friendly interface, which communicates with the back-end API to fetch and display laptop product data.

**Key Features:**

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - Utilizes the JSoup library to scrape laptop product data from e-commerce websites.
   - Extracts details such as product names, prices, specifications, and customer reviews.

2. **Database Storage:**
   - Stores the extracted data in a PostgreSQL database for efficient management and retrieval.
   - Enables advanced queries and analytics on the collected information.

3. **Back-End Development:**
   - Developed using Java and Spring Boot.
   - Encompasses web scraping functionality, database integration, and RESTful API creation.
   - Handles requests from the front-end, retrieves data from the database, and provides it in a consumable format.

4. **Front-End Display:**
   - Built with React to offer an intuitive and responsive user interface.
   - Fetches data from the back-end API and presents it in a visually appealing manner.
   - Allows users to browse, search for laptop products, view details, and access customer reviews.

**Usage:**
