**Project Description:**

This project is a web scraping application developed using Java and JSoup. Its primary purpose is to gather laptop product data from popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Trendyol, N11, and Teknosa. The extracted information is then stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and organization.

The application is built using the Spring Boot framework, which enables the creation of a robust and scalable back-end. Java is utilized for the implementation of the back-end logic, including the web scraping functionality and the integration with the database.

On the front-end, React is employed to provide a dynamic and user-friendly interface. The front-end utilizes fetch operations to communicate with the back-end API, enabling the retrieval and display of the laptop product data in a structured manner.

**Key Features:**
1. Web Scraping: The application utilizes the JSoup library to scrape laptop product data from e-commerce websites. This includes extracting details such as product names, prices, specifications, and customer reviews.
2. Database Storage: The extracted laptop product data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. This ensures efficient data management, easy retrieval, and the ability to perform advanced queries or analytics on the collected information.
3. Back-End Development: The back-end is developed using Java and Spring Boot. It encompasses the web scraping functionality, database integration, and the creation of a RESTful API. The API handles requests from the front-end, retrieves the relevant data from the database, and provides it in a consumable format.
4. Front-End Display: React is employed for building an intuitive and responsive user interface. The front-end fetches data from the back-end API and presents it in a visually appealing manner. Users can browse and search for laptop products, view their details, and access customer reviews.

**Usage:**
- Select the desired e-commerce websites (Amazon, Trendyol, N11, Teknosa) from which you want to scrape laptop product data.
- Initiate the web scraping process to extract information such as product names, prices, specifications, and customer reviews.
